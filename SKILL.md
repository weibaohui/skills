## PART 1: PRINCIPLES

### The Four Rules of Simple Design (Kent Beck)

1. **Runs all the tests** — Testable systems naturally push toward small, single-purpose classes and low coupling
2. **Contains no duplication** — Code, implementation, algorithm duplication. Even small duplication signals an unexpressed idea
3. **Expresses intent** — Good names, small functions/classes, standard nomenclature, well-written tests
4. **Minimizes classes and methods** — Keep small, but don't overdo it. Lowest priority

### SOLID Principles

| Principle | Rule | Refactoring Link |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **SRP** | One reason to change | Extract Class, Split Phase |
| **OCP** | Open for extension, closed for modification | Replace Conditional with Polymorphism |
| **LSP** | Subtypes must be substitutable | Replace Subclass with Delegate |
| **ISP** | Many specific interfaces over general one | Extract Superclass → Split Interface |
| **DIP** | Depend on abstractions | Extract Superclass, Introduce Parameter Object |

### Law of Demeter

A method should only call methods of: (a) itself, (b) objects it creates, (c) passed arguments, (d) instance variables. **"Talk to friends, not strangers."**

- **Train wrecks**: `a.b.c.d()` — avoid chaining method calls on returned objects
- Refactoring: Hide Delegate → tell the object to do something, don't ask for internals

### Command-Query Separation

Functions either do something OR answer something, never both. Refactoring: Separate Query from Modifier.

### Immutability

Prefer immutable data. When data must change: Split Variable, Replace Derived Variable with Query, Remove Setting Method.

### Abstraction

- **Objects**: Hide data behind abstractions, expose operations
- **Data structures**: Expose data, have no meaningful functions
- **Hybrids** (half object, half data): Worst of both worlds — avoid
- **DTOs**: Public vars, no functions — ok for DB/message parsing

## PART 2: CODE SMELLS (24 smells)

### Naming
| Smell | What It Is | Refactoring |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Mysterious Name** | Names don't convey purpose | Rename (Change Function Declaration, Rename Variable, Rename Field) |

### Duplication
| Smell | What It Is | Refactoring |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Duplicated Code** | Same code in multiple places | Extract Function → Move Function → Pull Up Method |
| **Data Clumps** | Same 3-4 fields always together | Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object |

### Functions
| Smell | What It Is | Refactoring |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Long Function** | Functions too long | Extract Function; if many temp vars: Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object; last resort: Replace Function with Command |
| **Long Parameter List** | Too many parameters | Replace Parameter with Query, Preserve Whole Object, Introduce Parameter Object, Remove Flag Argument |
| **Feature Envy** | Function uses more data from another module | Move Function (or Extract + Move) |
| **Loops** | Loops when pipelines would be clearer | Replace Loop with Pipeline |

### Data
| Smell | What It Is | Refactoring |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Global Data** | Data visible/modifiable from anywhere | Encapsulate Variable |
| **Mutable Data** | Data changes unexpectedly | Encapsulate Variable, Split Variable, Separate Query from Modifier, Remove Setting Method, Replace Derived Variable with Query |
| **Primitive Obsession** | Using primitives instead of small objects | Replace Primitive with Object, Replace Type Code with Subclasses + Replace Conditional with Polymorphism |

### Structure
| Smell | What It Is | Refactoring |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Divergent Change** | Module changed for different reasons | Split Phase, Move Function, Extract Class |
| **Shotgun Surgery** | One change requires edits in many places | Move Function, Move Field, Combine Functions into Class/Transform, Inline Function/Class |
| **Large Class** | Class doing too much | Extract Class, Extract Superclass |
| **Lazy Element** | Unnecessary program elements | Inline Function, Inline Class, Collapse Hierarchy |
| **Speculative Generality** | Unused features built "just in case" | Collapse Hierarchy, Inline Function/Class, Remove Dead Code |
| **Temporary Field** | Fields used only in special cases | Extract Class, Introduce Special Case |

### Coupling
| Smell | What It Is | Refactoring |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Message Chains** | `a.b.c.d` chain of calls | Hide Delegate |
| **Middle Man** | Class delegates too much | Remove Middle Man |
| **Insider Trading** | Excessive data exchange between modules | Move Function/Field, Hide Delegate, Replace Subclass/Superclass with Delegate |
| **Alternative Classes** | Similar classes with incompatible interfaces | Change Function Declaration, Move Function, Extract Superclass |

### Inheritance
| Smell | What It Is | Refactoring |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Repeated Switches** | Same switch logic in different places | Replace Conditional with Polymorphism |
| **Refused Bequest** | Subclass doesn't use inherited features | Push Down Method/Field, Replace Subclass/Superclass with Delegate |
| **Data Class** | Classes with only fields and getters/setters | Encapsulate Record, Move Function to bring behavior to data |

### Comments
| Smell | What It Is | Refactoring |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Comments** | Comments explaining what code does | Extract Function, Change Function Declaration (better naming), Introduce Assertion |

## PART 3: REFACTORING TECHNIQUES

### Ch6: First Set

**Extract Function** — When code needs comments; create function named by purpose → copy code → handle scope vars → replace original → test.

**Inline Function** — Reverse of Extract. When body = name clarity. Replace call sites with body → delete → test.

**Extract Variable** — Complex expression hard to read. Declare const with expression result → replace expression → test.

**Inline Variable** — Reverse of Extract Variable. Name doesn't add clarity. Verify no side effects → make const → replace all uses → delete.

**Change Function Declaration** — Simple: update declaration + call sites. Migratory: extract new → inline old → rename. Published: deprecate, wait, remove.

**Encapsulate Variable** — Data accessed from many places. Create getter/setter → replace direct accesses → restrict visibility.

**Rename Variable** — Wide-scope: encapsulate first → rename internal. Constants: create new → migrate → delete old.

**Introduce Parameter Object** — Data items always travel together. Create class/record for group → add parameter → migrate callers → replace individual params.

**Combine Functions into Class** — Functions always operate on same data. Encapsulate record → Move functions into class.

**Combine Functions into Transform** — Same derived data in multiple places. Create transform function → deep-copy input → add derived fields → update callers.

**Split Phase** — Two concerns handled sequentially. Extract second phase → introduce intermediate data structure → migrate params.

### Ch7: Encapsulation

**Encapsulate Record** — Record structure used widely. Encapsulate variable → create class wrapping record → add getters/setters → replace record accesses.

**Encapsulate Collection** — Getter returns mutable collection. Add add/remove methods; return copies from getter.

**Replace Primitive with Object** — Simple type needs behaviors. Encapsulate variable → create simple value class → modify accessors → add business logic.

**Replace Temp with Query** — Temp var used once but computation could be shared. Extract variable assignment to query function → inline original variable.

**Extract Class** — Class has too many responsibilities. Create new class → establish connection → Move Field → Move Function → clean up.

**Inline Class** — Reverse of Extract Class. Create delegation methods on target → redirect callers → move all → delete source.

**Hide Delegate** — Client calls `a.b.method()`. Add delegation method on service object → redirect callers.

**Remove Middle Man** — Reverse of Hide Delegate. Add accessor for delegate → redirect callers → remove delegation methods.

**Substitute Algorithm** — Simpler algorithm available. Extract algorithm to function → prepare tests → write new → test.

### Ch8: Moving Features

**Move Function** — Function references more from target context. Check references → copy to target → adjust → make source delegate → optionally inline.

**Move Field** — Data used with another record. Ensure field encapsulated → create field + accessors on target → remove source field.

**Move Statements into Function** — Same code runs alongside a function call. If single caller: paste. Multiple: Extract Function → redirect → inline → rename.

**Move Statements to Callers** — Function boundary shifted. Cut and paste, or Extract Function → inline original → rename.

**Replace Inline Code with Function Call** — Code duplicates library function. Replace with function call; test.

**Slide Statements** — Related code separated. Check side effects → cut and paste → test.

**Split Loop** — Loop does two unrelated things. Duplicate loop → remove cross-concern code → Extract Function on each.

**Replace Loop with Pipeline** — Loop expressible as filter/map. Create pipeline variable → progressively replace with pipeline ops → delete loop.

**Remove Dead Code** — Code no longer referenced. Remove it; test; rely on version control.

### Ch9: Data

**Split Variable** — Variable serves multiple purposes. Rename at first assignment → create new const at second → update references. Exception: accumulators (i++, sum += x).

**Rename Field** — Wide-scope: Encapsulate Record first → rename internal. Small scope: direct rename.

**Replace Derived Variable with Query** — Variable can be computed from other data. Create calculation function → assert equality → switch readers to query → remove variable.

**Change Reference to Value** — Internal object should be immutable. Make object immutable → add value-based equals → override hashCode.

**Change Value to Reference** — Multiple copies need to stay consistent. Create repository → ensure constructor finds instance → modify constructor to use repository.

### Ch10: Conditionals

**Decompose Conditional** — Complex condition logic. Extract condition, then-branch, else-branch into named functions. Pattern: `if (summer()) return summerCharge(); else return regularCharge();`

**Consolidate Conditional Expression** — Multiple conditions lead to same result. Combine with `||` or `&&` → Extract Function with descriptive name.

**Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses** — One branch is main logic; others are pre-checks. Convert outermost condition to early return → repeat → remove result variable.

**Replace Conditional with Polymorphism** — Multiple switch statements on same type code. Create class hierarchy → factory function → move type-specific logic to subclasses.

**Introduce Special Case** — Multiple places check for same special value. Extract check to function → create special case object with default behaviors → replace conditional with polymorphic calls.

**Introduce Assertion** — Code assumes a condition is always true. Add assert statement; should never change behavior.

### Ch11: API Refactoring

**Separate Query from Modifier** — Function returns value AND has side effects. Duplicate function as query → remove side effects → redirect callers → remove return from modifier.

**Parameterize Function** — Two functions differ only in literal values. Add parameter for varying value → update callers → merge similar functions.

**Remove Flag Argument** — Parameter is boolean/enum controlling behavior. Create explicit functions for each behavior → replace flag-based calls.

**Preserve Whole Object** — Multiple values extracted from one object and passed together. Create new function accepting whole object → redirect callers → inline old function.

**Replace Parameter with Query** — Parameter can be derived from another parameter or context. Extract parameter computation to query → replace parameter usage → remove parameter.

**Replace Query with Parameter** — Reverse of above. Remove dependency on global/unwanted element; restore referential transparency.

**Remove Setting Method** — Field should not change after construction. Move value to constructor parameter → redirect setter calls → inline setter → make field immutable.

**Replace Constructor with Factory Function** — Constructor limited (can't return subclass, fixed name). Create factory function calling constructor → redirect callers → narrow constructor visibility.

**Replace Function with Command** — Complex function needs decomposition beyond Extract Function. Create class → Move function → promote params to constructor fields → Extract Function on pieces.

**Replace Command with Function** — Reverse of above. Extract create+execute to function → inline all command methods → delete command class.

### Ch12: Inheritance

**Pull Up Method** — Identical methods in multiple subclasses. Verify identical → ensure features accessible from super → copy to super → remove from subclasses.

**Pull Up Field** — Same field duplicated in subclasses. Verify same usage → create in super (protected) → remove from subclasses.

**Pull Up Constructor Body** — Common initialization in subclass constructors. Ensure super has constructor → move common statements after super().

**Push Down Method** — Function in super only relevant to some subclasses. Copy to relevant subclasses → remove from super.

**Push Down Field** — Field only used by some subclasses. Declare in relevant subclasses → remove from super.

**Replace Type Code with Subclasses** — Type code with different behavior per value. Self-encapsulate type code → create subclass overriding type getter → Factory Function → repeat for each type → remove type code.

**Remove Subclass** — Subclass no longer needed. Encapsulate construction with factory → move type checks to super → add type field → delete subclass.

**Extract Superclass** — Two classes doing similar things. Create empty super → Pull Up Constructor Body → Pull Up Field → Pull Up Method.

**Collapse Hierarchy** — Subclass and super too similar. Choose which to keep → Pull Up/Push Down all elements → delete empty class.

**Replace Subclass with Delegate** — Inheritance misused; need dynamic type changes. Factory function → create delegate class → add delegate field → Move subclass methods to delegate → add dispatch logic → change factory → delete subclass.

**Replace Superclass with Delegate** — Superclass operations not all applicable. Create field referencing super → create forwarding methods → remove inheritance.

## PART 4: CODE QUALITY

### Naming Rules

- **Intention-revealing**: Name answers *why it exists*, *what it does*, *how it is used*. If name needs a comment → not good enough.
- **Avoid disinformation**: Don't use near-misses of established concepts.
- **Meaningful distinctions**: No arbitrary suffixes (`a1, a2`), noise words (`ProductInfo` vs `ProductData`).
- **Pronounceable**: `genymdhms` → `generationTimestamp`
- **Searchable**: Single-letter names and magic numbers are unsearchable. Name length ↔ scope size.
- **No encoding**: No Hungarian Notation (`m_` prefix, type prefixes).
- **No mental mapping**: Don't make readers translate names.
- **By type**: Class = noun phrase (never verb). Method = verb phrase. Pick one word per concept. Use solution domain names when available.
- **Anti-patterns**: Number-series naming, noise words, cute names, `l` and `O` as variable names.

### Function Design Rules

- **Small**: First rule: be small. Second rule: be smaller. Hardly ever >20 lines.
- **Do one thing**: Extract another function whose name is not a restatement of implementation → does more than one thing.
- **One abstraction level per function**: Follow **Stepdown Rule** — read like top-down narrative.
- **Arguments**: Ideal = 0 (niladic). Next = 1 (monadic). 2 is ok. Avoid 3+.
  - Flag arguments are ugly (boolean params splitting behavior)
  - Use argument objects when groups travel together
  - No output arguments — in OO, `this` is the output
- **No side effects**: `checkPassword` should not initialize sessions.
- **Command-Query Separation**: Either do something OR answer something, never both.
- **DRY**: Duplication is the root of all evil.
- **Prefer exceptions to returning error codes**: Avoids deep nesting.
- **Anti-patterns**: Long functions (100+ lines), flag arguments, output arguments, functions with side effects, deeply nested error code checking.

### Comments Rules

**Don't comment bad code — rewrite it.** Comments are a necessary evil — compensation for failure to express yourself in code.

**Good comments**: Legal, informative, intent (explaining *why*), clarification (translating obscure API params), warning, TODO, public API Javadocs.

**Bad comments**: Mumbling, redundant, misleading, mandated, journal (use version control), noise, position markers, closing brace comments, attributions, commented-out code, HTML comments, function headers on small functions.

### Formatting Rules

- **File size**: ~200 lines, max 500. Small files easier to understand.
- **Newspaper metaphor**: Top = high-level concepts. Details increase downward.
- **Vertical openness**: Blank lines separate distinct thoughts.
- **Vertical density**: Related code should be vertically dense.
- **Line length**: ~45 chars. No more than 100-120.
- **Indentation**: Essential for hierarchy. Don't collapse scopes to one line.

### Class Design Rules

- **Small**: Measured by *responsibilities*, not lines. Can't name it → too big.
- **SRP**: One and only one reason to change.
- **High cohesion**: Methods should use instance variables. When cohesion drops → split class.
- **Encapsulation**: Keep variables and utility functions private.
- **Organization**: Constants → static vars → instance vars → public functions → private utilities (Stepdown Rule).
- **OCP**: Open for extension, closed for modification.
- **DIP**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete details. Use interfaces and DI.
- **Anti-patterns**: "God classes", classes with multiple reasons to change, mixed responsibilities, hybrid objects.

### Error Handling Rules

- **Use exceptions rather than return codes**: Return codes clutter caller, easily forgotten.
- **Write try-catch-finally first**: Try blocks define scope like transactions.
- **Use unchecked exceptions**: Checked exceptions violate OCP.
- **Provide context with exceptions**: Each exception should contain enough info to determine source.
- **Define exception classes by caller's needs**: Wrap third-party APIs.
- **Don't return/null**: Creates cascading null checks. Return special case objects instead.
- **Don't pass null**: Forbid passing null. Use assertions or throw exceptions.
- **Special Case Pattern**: Create objects that handle special cases, so client code doesn't need exceptional behavior.
- **Anti-patterns**: Deep nesting of if-checks, checked exceptions cascading, returning null, passing null, scattered error handling.

### Boundary Rules

- **Don't pass Map (or other boundary interfaces) around your system**: Keep boundary interfaces inside classes.
- **Learning Tests**: Write tests that explore and verify your understanding of third-party APIs.
- **Design the interface you wish you had**: Create your own ideal interface, then use an ADAPTER to bridge.
- **Clean boundaries**: Minimize the places that reference third-party code. Depend on what you control.
- **Patterns**: ADAPTER pattern, Facade over third-party APIs.
- **Anti-patterns**: Passing collection types in public APIs, scattered references to third-party APIs.

### Testing Rules

**TDD Three Laws**: (1) Write failing test first, (2) Write minimum test to fail, (3) Write minimum code to pass.

**Core rules**: Test code is as important as production code. Tests enable change, flexibility, maintainability. Clean tests = readability.

**Patterns**: BUILD-OPERATE-CHECK. Domain-Specific Testing Language. One assert per test (guideline).

**F.I.R.S.T.**: Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-Validating, Timely.

**Self-testing code**: Ensure all tests are completely automated. Run tests after every small change. Characterization tests for legacy code.

**Anti-patterns**: Tests that depend on execution order, long test methods, tests that aren't self-validating, manual test execution.

### System Design Rules

- **Separate construction from use**: Move construction to `main` or dedicated modules. Use Factories for runtime object creation. **Dependency Injection**: Objects should not instantiate their own dependencies.
- **Scaling up incrementally**: Systems don't need to be "right the first time." Implement today's stories, refactor.
- **Cross-cutting concerns**: Use AOP for persistence, security, transactions.
- **Test-Drive architecture**: No Big Design Up Front (BDUF).
- **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)**: Minimize communication gap between domain concepts and code.
- **Anti-patterns**: Lazy initialization scattered throughout, heavyweight containers, over-engineered APIs, tight coupling.

### Concurrency Rules

- **SRP**: Keep concurrency code separate from other code.
- **Limit scope of data**: Use data encapsulation; severely limit access to shared data.
- **Use copies of data**: Avoid sharing by copying objects as read-only.
- **Threads as independent as possible**: Each thread processes one client request with unshared data.
- **Know your library**: Use concurrent collections, executor framework, nonblocking solutions.
- **Keep synchronized sections small**: Locks are expensive, minimize critical sections.
- **Shut-down code is hard**: Think about shut-down early.
- **Anti-patterns**: Embedding concurrency in business code, sharing mutable data without synchronization, large critical sections, ignoring spurious failures.

### Emergence Rules

- **Refactoring**: Write code, then refactor incrementally. Each few lines, ask "Did I degrade the design?"
- **TEMPLATE METHOD pattern**: Remove higher-level duplication by extracting invariant algorithm skeleton.
- **Reuse in the small leads to reuse in the large**: Extracting tiny commonalities can lead to recognizing SRP violations.
- **Expressiveness through care**: Choose better names, split large functions, take care of what you've created.
- **Anti-patterns**: Pointless dogmatism, creating too many tiny classes in the name of SRP, skipping the refactoring step.

---

## PART 5: WHEN TO REFACTOR

### Why Refactor

- **Improves software design**: Without refactoring, code accumulates technical debt.
- **Makes software easier to understand**: Refactoring helps people understand the code.
- **Helps find bugs**: By understanding the system, we can see where bugs are.
- **Helps programming speed**: Well-factored code allows us to go faster in the long run.

### When to Refactor

- **Preparatory Refactoring**: Make it easier to add a feature. First refactor to make the feature easy to add.
- **Comprehension Refactoring**: Understanding code before modifying. Refactor to make it clearer.
- **Litter-Pickup Refactoring**: Small cleanup. Do it — don't let it pile up.
- **Planned vs. Opportunistic**: Refactoring as part of planned work or as you go.
- **Code Review Refactoring**: Refactor as part of code review to incorporate feedback.

### When NOT to Refactor

- When existing code is a mess (sometimes easier to rewrite)
- When you're about to throw the code away
- When you're on a tight deadline

### Challenges

- Delaying new features, code ownership, branches, testing, legacy code, database refactoring.

### Performance

- Refactoring usually makes programs slower, but degradation is small and manageable.
- Profile first, then refactor. Clean code is easier to tune.

### YAGNI

Don't write code for the future. Write only what you need now. Refactor when the future arrives.
